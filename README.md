# Pokemon Card Detector

Creator: [Justin Mazon](https://github.com/JustintheBox)

## Project Description
The process started by collecting a large dataset of images of Pokemon cards (15,000+). I then used this dataset to determine every perceptual hash value of each image and save it into a .csv file.

Once that was done, I integrated it into a Python script that could process video frames in real-time and identify any Pokemon cards that appeared on screen by comparing its phash value to the dataset.

The final result is a tool that can accurately detect Pokemon cards from a camera and tell you its latest price from API.
